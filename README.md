Things you will need to configure in the code.

The User ID and Passwords are in the include/secrets.h file.

The rest of them are in the include/configuration.h file.

I'm just a Hobbyist Programmer and at Electronics so feel free to make suggestions to make it better.

For the Hardware assembly and 3D printed parts go here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7142681

There is only one program file and two include files so you should be able to bring in the code into Arduino 2.x and program your ESP32C6 from there if your not familiar with VSCode and PlatformIO. Probably just create a new project and copy in the code. Make sure to add the libraries listed in the platformio.ini file.

I haven't tried it but programming the ESP32C6 with ESPHome should work though.
The components I have used are in ESPHome.
